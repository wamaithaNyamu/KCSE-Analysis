## Findings

### 1. Yearly enrollment for both gender
![Finding Yearly enrollment for both gender](./images/one.png)


    After 2010, the number of kcse students dramatically increased.In 2003, the governemnt introduced free primary education and in 2008 free secondary day school education. This factors can be attributed to the number of students having shot up
    In 2016 more female students sat for the exams as compared to male students


### 2. Change in performance for both genders
![Finding Change in performance for both genders](./images/two.png)


    Performance declined sharply in 2016. This was also the period CS MAtiangi was the CS for education.
    In 2016 girls, the performance change was off for girls than for boys


### 3. Comparison of distribution of genders per grade per year

    On average boys have high numbers in every grade
    2011 to 2015 more boys had A's as compared to girls, but come 2016 when the rate of exam cheating was very low, the number of A's between girls and boys was very close. Would this mean in general boys cheat one xams more than girls?
    In 2016 more females had E's than males. It was also the only year the number of E's was higher for females than male.


### 4. Yearly gender that performed the best
